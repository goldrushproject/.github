This project consist of four separate repositories, two AWS accounts, and a data dashboard on AWS Quicksight.

The four repositories hold code for the four main microservices that constitute the GoldRush application:
ETL: https://github.com/goldrushproject/yfinance-data-etl
Model Training: https://github.com/goldrushproject/serverless-train
Model Inference: https://github.com/goldrushproject/serverless-inference
Combined Data Assessment: https://github.com/goldrushproject/data-assess

The client dashboard can be accessed through this link:

(You must log into the provided viewer account in order to access the dashboard)

This project does not require any active testing in order to function, it can be checked by viewing the client dashboard.
